This folder contains reshard test suite for zbase-reshard script

What the Framework does:
Based on the inputs in the config file:
- It checks if the test machines are reachable.
- Generates SSH key and distributes it across test machine, if GENERATE_SSH_KEYS is set to True.
- Ensures  python-simplejson python-pycurl are installed on source machines, 
- Ensure pdsh is installed on the machine where this script is run. 
- Sets up Source and Destination pool
- Runs the following:
** Test for scaling up and scaling down zbase servers.
** Test for rejected keys function
** Test for corrupted keys
** Test GET API with and without checksum enabled for keys with and without checksum set.
** Test keys set with expiry
** Test Basci API's Set, Replace, CAS, Append, Prepend, Delete from the new pool for keys with and without checksum set.

To run the test:
1. Download the reshard_script_test folder git clone git git@github-ca.corp.zynga.com:sbkrishnamurthy/zbase_automation.git
2. cd reshard_script_test/
3. Edit the config file 
	a. The framework uses key based auth. Set GENERATE_SSH_KEYS to True if key has to generated + distributed across test machines. This would prompt for LDAP password.
		Setting GENERATE_SSH_KEYS to False assumes that private / public keys are already present.
	b. Five test machines are needed to run this test. Input the same under $test_machine_list.
	c. Build information - This field can take up combination of builds where the test needs to be run. Either only Zbase or Zbase + Pecl can be specified in the below format:
		Zbase1 => Zbase2 or Zbase1:php-pecl1 => Zbase2:Php-pecl2 
4. Run -- php reshard_script_test.php
