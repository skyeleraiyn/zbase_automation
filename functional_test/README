This folder contains functional test suites of Zbase, php-pecl, Mcmux testcases

What the Framework does:
Based on the inputs in the config file:
- It checks if the test machines are reachable.
- Installs the required build if specified and copies the startup files
- Starts Zbase servers

To run the test:
1. Download the zbase_automation folder git clone git git@github-ca.corp.zynga.com:sbkrishnamurthy/zbase_automation.git
2. cd functional_test
3. Edit the config file 
	a. The framework uses key based auth. Set GENERATE_SSH_KEYS to True if key has to generated + distributed across test machines. This would prompt for LDAP password.
		Setting GENERATE_SSH_KEYS to False assumes that private / public keys are already present.
	b. test_machine_list needs the list of machines which will be used for testing.
	c. ZBASE_VERSION - define this as the right file needed for starting zbase will be copied based on this.
	d. Build information - This field can take multiple builds for the same components. Tests will be run across each build combination. Define BUILD_FOLDER_PATH path to place all the builds inside this.
	e. test_suite_array – Define the test which needs to be run ( Zbase-smoke, Zbase-regression, …)
4. php run_test.php
